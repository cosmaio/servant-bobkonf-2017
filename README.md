# Requirements for the Servant tutorial at Bobkonf 2017

I will be using:

- GHC 8.0.2
- Servant 0.9

In essence, you should be safe with LTS 8.

While the exact packages we will need depend somewhat on where the questions
and discussion will take us, I've tried to prepare a probable Cabal package
specification and a `stack.yaml` as well as a trivial `cabal.project` so that
everyone can use their favourite package management tool.

So if you can install the dependencies of the (empty) package at

  https://github.com/kosmikus/servant-bobkonf-2017

then everything should be fine.
